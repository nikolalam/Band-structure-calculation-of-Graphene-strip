# Band-structure-calculation-of-Graphene-strip
In this file, I give a serval code for the calculation of band structure of zigzag graphene in different model.
It contains the following model:

1. an ordainry graphene model with only nearest neighbor hopping
2. graphene ribbon with mass breaking term
3. Haldane model
4. Kane-Mele Model

Python was used to write these scripts and the numpy and matplot are required package when you run the code. You can directly copy the script and paste on your editor to run it.
